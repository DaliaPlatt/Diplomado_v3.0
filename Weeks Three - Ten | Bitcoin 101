# Definition of Bitcoin and its Components

## Introduction to Bitcoin

- **Definitions**
    - *What:* Bitcoin is a program that can be downloaded and run on any computer.
    - *What it does:* Lets you store, send, and receive money without any banks, credit card companies, or government bodies.
    - *What it doesn’t have:* A central authority or centralized ledger.
        - **Ledger:** A document or file that maintains a list of transactions.
    - *How it works without a centralized ledger or centralized authority:* It uses a Blockchain.
        - **Blockchain:** A decentralized, distributed ledger. A way of recording information that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat it.
    - *Who can use it?* Unlike the traditional banking system, **anybody.**
    - *What does it run on?*
        - **Open source code:** Software code (or a computer program) that anyone can see, modify, and distribute as they see fit. So imagine this like going to a restaurant and having access to the recipes of your favorite meals… but then you can make them and add any or take away any ingredient that you wish and perfect them for your family dinners.
            
            ![A90264C6-652D-42BA-B2C2-6E79B6D0EDDA.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6ce45123-5510-4c97-b421-49f5345475a1/A90264C6-652D-42BA-B2C2-6E79B6D0EDDA.png)
            
    - Bitcoin vs. bitcoin: **Bitcoin** with a ‘B’, refers to a network of computers, all running the same program, whereas **bitcoin** with a ‘b’ refers to the cryptocurrency on which the program runs on.
    - More Definitions:
        - **Bitcoin Node:** *any computer that runs a Bitcoin implementation (software) and stores the entire blockchain.*
        - **Miner:** *A computer, or series of computers, that perform an energy-intensive process, competing to solve mathematical puzzles to receive bitcoin, and in so doing, verify transactions for the network.*
    - Some differences between Bitcoin and traditional currencies are illustrated in the table below.
        
        

- **Centralized vs. Decentralized Systems**
    
    ![https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/centralized-decentralized-systems-cryptocurrency.png](https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/centralized-decentralized-systems-cryptocurrency.png)
    
    - **Features of a Centralized System (Left half of the graphic):**
        - Operates through the use of computers, networks, and technologies that are owned, operated, and maintained by financial institutions.
        - Every single transaction has to go through the central banking system, where it’s recorded in a centralized ledger.
        - The system is restricted — only a small number of organizations (banks and governments) are allowed to connect directly and/or control the rules, verify that people are acting in good faith, enforce the regulations and keep a copy of all the transactions.
    - **Features of a Decentralized System** **such as The Bitcoin Network** **(Right half of the graphic)** is described as a “[peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) network” because:
        1. Nodes are connected to each other using the internet, so it’s a network.
        2. Everyone is responsible for his/her own device but lends and shares his/her resources.
        3. Everyone on the network is equal 
        4. Everyone shares the responsibility of verifying transactions, updating, and discarding redundant versions of the ledger simultaneously.
            
            ![DB488886-1FA6-4256-A80F-91CC49D9F998.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/42e0cf4a-b872-4dcf-a4e7-004e5f919933/DB488886-1FA6-4256-A80F-91CC49D9F998.jpeg)
            
        - *The Participants in a Decentralized System*
            - **Miners**: Are computers in a race against each other to solve mathematical puzzles that will create new bitcoins with the ultimate purpose of verifying transactions. They are like the “employees” of the system, who need to keep everything in order.
            - **Exchanges**: Trade fiat currencies for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Offer a way in and out of the market for non-miners.
            - **Wallets**: Used by individuals to send and receive bitcoin.
        
        - Bitcoin Uses a Decentralized Distributed System
            - Distribution refers to a network where all computers work together in a coordinated fashion to achieve a common goal. Nodes can be honest, faulty, or malicious and have their own memory and processor.  Even if a node is faulty or a link breaks, the system should be able to tolerate this and continue working flawlessly.
            
            ![https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cryptocurrency-distributed-ledger.png](https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cryptocurrency-distributed-ledger.png)
            
        - **Questions:**
            - Without a central bank, how can nodes be sure that everyone is listening to the same transactions and all at the same time, especially if there exist malicious and faulty nodes?
            - How would we know that a person really is who they claim to be with this system, being that there is no central bank to verify identities?
            - How can we be sure that a person has enough money in their account to pay for something we are selling them, being that there is no central database to check?
- **How the Blockchain Works**
    - Anyone who wants to run this program will then connect to the network of computers that communicate with each other. All this happens for one reason…to share an ever-larger file of ever-growing data; this file is the blockchain! The computers distribute an accounting report that reflects all the transactions that are happening, and have ever happened, in real-time.
        - These networks encode and decode data with secure cryptography, revolutionizing the way information is shared. When making a bitcoin payment, for instance, you don’t need to provide any sensitive information. That means there is almost zero risk of your financial information being compromised, or your identity being stolen.
        
        ![https://learnmeabitcoin.com/common/images/home/1_2_network.png](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/common/images/home/1_2_network.png)
        
    - The Bitcoin Blockchain...
        - **Skips Middlemen.** Skipping middlemen makes transfers of payments between any two parties anywhere in the world faster and cheaper.
        - **Is Secure.** There is no need of a third-party verifier like a bank. With public key-cryptography (more on this later), you can prove that you have a secret without actually having to reveal it. Breaching the network is extremely difficult (has never been done in the BTC network).
        - **Tracks Payments Permanently.** Like a bank’s ledger, the blockchain tracks all the money flowing into, out of, and through the network, but unlike a financial institution, it keeps a permanent record of all transactions that have ever happened on it. Strong computer code ensures that nobody can change these records after the fact. Once information is added to the blockchain, it’s impossible to remove it.
        - **Is Distributed.** Unlike a bank’s books, a crypto blockchain isn’t maintained by any one individual or organization, which includes banks and governments. In fact, it isn’t centralized at all. Instead, it is secured by a large peer-to-peer, decentralized network ****of ****computers running open-source software**.**  The network is constantly checking and securing the accuracy of the blockchain. These are a lot of words to digest in a few sentences… we will get to all of them and clarify.

class 4

- **The Problem of Double-Spending**
    - **Double-Spending:** When someone sends two conflicting transactions into the network at the same time.
    - **EXAMPLE:**
        - Let’s say Sarah owes both Bill and Tom 0.2 BTC, but has exactly 0.2 BTC in her wallet. She creates two transactions simultaneously. She sends 0.2 BTC to Bill and also sends 0.2 BTC to Tom. Just as if she had created one email and sent it to two different people declaring her love to them. She sends each transaction to different nodes on the network thinking she can cheat the system.
            
            ![521AFA43-F74D-412A-9572-7E4C5199BA48.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4555f9c6-54af-40e7-aeda-fe1f34a4599f/521AFA43-F74D-412A-9572-7E4C5199BA48.png)
            
        - Both of these transactions can't be written to the file! That would be a double-spend. Still, we have a network of computers with conflicting transactions on them, and no single computer is in charge. So how can we decide? Instead of using a central banking system to verify transactions, Bitcoin uses a process called **mining.**
- **Miners and Mining**
    
    Mining hardware is made up of specialized computers, created solely to assemble valid transactions into blocks and receive block rewards.  The more powerful the hardware, and the more energy-efficient, the more likely it will be profitable in generating new bitcoin.
    
    - Miners compete to solve hard math problems.
    - The goal of the math problem is to find a number (hash) below a specific target number.
    - Once someone finds a number that works, the block is “solved”, that particular lucky miner (or group of miners) gets the reward.
        
        ![47816744-EBA9-4B80-A8B4-2857413C64DD.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5283b60c-b499-4be0-90d7-8284d294780e/47816744-EBA9-4B80-A8B4-2857413C64DD.png)
        
    - As an incentive for the energy expended and effort in mining new blocks of transactions onto the blockchain, each new block rewards the winning miner with some bitcoin that did not previously exist.
    - The miner that is successful at mining a block gets a specified amount of bitcoin.
    - The lucky miner broadcasts the new block to the network to be verified by the nodes, and once the nodes agree that the block is valid, the block (and all of the transactions within it) are added to the blockchain.
    - Nodes trust the blockchain with the most computational work to reach consensus.
    - Other nodes look for transactions, verify them, and broadcast blocks and maintain an up-to-date ledger.
    - Depending on the amount of energy the miners put in (or more precisely, the amount of hash rate the energy they put in produces), their odds are increased that they’ll get to mine the next block. This is because the odds of solving the math problem is proportionate to the amount of hash rate a miner produces — so if a miner produces 1% of the overall hash rate, it is expected that it will solve 1% of all blocks with which it is engaged over a long enough period of time.
        
        ![EB44ACDE-621E-4227-8386-021824505FB0.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cdf5ff35-b7bb-46ee-9dae-e277a082c409/EB44ACDE-621E-4227-8386-021824505FB0.png)
        
        - The way Bitcoin validates transactions, as described above, is called Proof of Work (POW) and is necessary for security, preventing fraud and enabling trust.
        - POW works well because finding the target number is difficult but verifying it isn't. The process is difficult enough to prevent the manipulation of transaction records. At the same time, once a target number is found, it's easy for other miners to check it.
        - Finding a valid hash is a purely random process.
        - Modern computers can easily calculate billions of hashes per second. The current hashrate of the Bitcoin Network (all miners combined) is estimated to be around 50 Exahashes (!)  per second.
        
- **Memory Pool**
    - **What is it?**
        - A waiting area where all transactions are held before they’re put into a block and made part of the blockchain.
    - **Why do we need it? [(Borrowed from Source)](https://cryptoadventure.com/understanding-bitcoin-mempool-and-why-its-so-important/)**
        - It’s a place where miners can decide which transactions they want to put into the next block.
        - Transactions are sent with certain priority (you can choose this priority, and pay more or less for that, when making the transaction!). During certain times where there is heavy traffic, miners will pick the ones with the highest priority to send first, leaving the ones with lower priority to arrive later. Those with the lowest priority (and the lowest transaction fees) will be put into a block once traffic has lowered for the other priority tiers.
        - Remember: the size of a block is only 1MB, and can hold only a few thousand transactions at most, so it’s important to choose.
        - The Bitcoin Mempool provides the network to manage and monitor all transactions from one convenient location. Both miners and users benefit from this protocol.
            - For miners, the Mempool equalizes the level of commissions in the network.
            - For users, it provides an extra layer of security and resistance against [DDoS attacks](https://cryptoadventure.com/bitfinex-and-okex-victims-of-ddos-attacks/). DDoS attacks occur when a network is flooded with minuscule transactions to provide unmanageable congestion.
        - Each node has a mempool.
        - Steps in a Bitcoin transaction:
            - The creation of a send within a Bitcoin wallet.
            - The Mempool receives the transaction request.
            - These requests reside in the Mempool, awaiting a miner’s selection. This way the Mempool allows for large amounts of transactions to be processed efficiently.
            - The miners sort through the awaiting transactions in the Mempool and select their choices to include in the next block.
                - Frees up more room in the Mempool. This freeing up of space is crucial because the closer the Mempool is to 1MB, the faster all transactions will complete.
            - After a transaction is selected from the Mempool, it’s included in the block and verified by all of the Bitcoin nodes available. After receiving 3-6 confirmations from the network, it’s officially added to the blockchain and part of the immutable [chain of transactions](https://cryptoadventure.com/on-chain-vs-off-chain-transactions-the-main-differences/).
        - As an incentive to use processing power to try and add new blocks of transactions on to the blockchain, each new block makes available a fixed amount of bitcoins that did not previously exist. Therefore, whoever successfully mines a block, is able to “send” themselves these new bitcoins as a reward for their effort.

class 5

- **Bitcoin Network**
    - Made up of the “bitcoin clients” — everyone running the bitcoin software. They send each other messages about what’s going on in the network by sending each other messages (new transaction, for example).
    - **Bitcoin Core** — The original program created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 to run Bitcoin. (It helps decide which blockchain is the valid one.)
        - To run it, you need to download ****and ****store ****the ****full ****blockchain.
        - Every time another copy of the blockchain is created, the network becomes more secure and transactions to other computers become easier to relay.
        - However, not everyone has the hard drive space to store their own copy of the blockchain. Instead of running Bitcoin Core to send and receive bitcoin, people can simply use something called a bitcoin “wallet”.
        - When a new transaction enters the network, it gets *relayed* from computer to computer until everyone has a copy of the transaction.
        
        ![F1A51E23-BD07-4528-B89D-6A01535ADF34.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cebebe05-bee5-4872-b934-a0a5e19d9a7b/F1A51E23-BD07-4528-B89D-6A01535ADF34.png)
        
        - Transactions get stored temporarily in a place called the node’s memory pool. At roughly 10 minute intervals, a random computer (node) on the network will certain transactions they have received onto a block. This block will be broadcast across the network to be verified by the other nodes, and added on the blockchain. More on this in a bit.
- **The Network Security**
    
    Although we spoke about having wallets and being able to send and receive bitcoin, we have not really talked about the network’s security, and why we should be so calm when sending money to someone we do not even know or trust. How do we make sure someone is not stealing another person’s identity in any transaction? Or, how to we know that a person has enough money in their account to actually pay for what they want? Let’s see step by step how this actually works.
    
    ![1CAEE62B-2AEE-442C-9CA6-31123A375F85.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/10c3a208-e2f6-4fb5-a8be-e2c3175af575/1CAEE62B-2AEE-442C-9CA6-31123A375F85.jpeg)
    
    1. Once connected to the network, without the need to ask anybody for permission, a person can generate a [private key](https://numbergenerator.org/random-256-bit-binary-number), followed by a public key. The private key will be a combination of numbers, composed of 256 bits. This means that the number of possible numbers that can be created is almost as many as the number of atoms in our universe. So if you are thinking if two people can ever create the same private key, the answer is essentially NO! 
        - [ ]  Look below at the red number, that is one possible private key.
    
    ![8B5BF40F-1419-4E22-BC21-CB261BE9A24C.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5b1fcb0d-d372-435f-b0f8-557b2cc91be1/8B5BF40F-1419-4E22-BC21-CB261BE9A24C.png)
    
    Then, using a mathematical function called an [elliptic curve](https://andrea.corbellini.name/ecc/interactive/reals-mul.html), and starting at an initial random point P, you  perform a mathematical operation which requires multiplying that point times the private key, N, (with a process called elliptic curve multiplication). The curve and the original point P is a shared value everybody knows and agreed to use.  This new point, NP is your public key (the blue one). This process is safe (it is a one-way function); it will be nearly impossible for someone to find a user’s private key, N,  for someone who knows just NP and P.
    
     
    
    ![B9916D0F-8945-48AA-B23B-6B4AC59E2996.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/419a2ea8-51bd-4906-a46b-38673116c80f/B9916D0F-8945-48AA-B23B-6B4AC59E2996.png)
    
    1. After shrinking your public key, NP,  to a more user-friendly version, which we will now call an address, you can now share it with anyone who wants to send you BTC. Or, if you want to send BTC to others, you will request their address. 
        
        When we say shrinking, we refer to using another mathematical function called “[hashing](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html)”.
        
        - Hash Functions
            
            A cryptographic hash function is a mini computer program that takes in any amount of data, scrambles it, and produces a digital fingerprint of it.
            
            ![0EDA862E-1805-4CF2-8C74-AE6E108B0216.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ecc59f22-26ce-4af0-aa3b-5b7780a2c6b8/0EDA862E-1805-4CF2-8C74-AE6E108B0216.png)
            
            The amazing thing about hash functions is that:
            
            - You can put as much data as you want in to the hash function, but it will always return the same-length result.
            - The result is unique, so you can use it as a way to identify that data.
            
            So in other words, a hash function allows you to create a fixed-length result for whatever data you put in to it.
            
            ![4F24181C-BCF2-4A31-A247-8AE4AF9E090B.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e2edaf14-0811-4071-b4b3-c7815f9ae22a/4F24181C-BCF2-4A31-A247-8AE4AF9E090B.png)
            
            The particular hash function that Bitcoin uses is called SHA256.
            
            ![8400F5F5-4546-40FA-BB32-7DB8AA1309D3.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8525dbea-5c65-4e18-ba0b-17f0687261c0/8400F5F5-4546-40FA-BB32-7DB8AA1309D3.png)
            
    2. This is where the security of Bitcoin gets interesting. When sending bitcoin to others, like with handwritten signatures on checks, every person must be able to add something unique next to each transaction, authenticating and approving it. This is called the digital signature.  Think of stirring together your private key, your compressed message and another random number from an elliptic curve, all into a bag, and then making a new number out of the result. That new number is the digital signature for that transaction. A digital signature is used to show that you know the private key connected to public key in question, without having to reveal it. So there is never a need to reveal your private key!!

        - [ ]  Every digital signature is unique to that transaction.
        - [ ]  If someone tries to use the same digital signature in a different transaction, it will conflict with the data and the nodes on the network will reject it.
        - [ ]  Remember that your bitcoin are locked by your public key.
        - [ ]  The goal of the digital signature is to prove that you are the owner of the public key.
    
    1. The verification happens by running it through another round of elliptic curve mathematic “magic”.  Although the process seems is quite complicated, the miner just has to wait for the computer to do the work. It is all programmed into the software and is extremely simple. If three specific points on the curve form a straight line, then the digital signature is valid, and the transaction will be confirmed. If the points do not line up, then the transaction is rejected.
        
        ![EA846431-4FE2-46CB-810F-E9D9D18F7409.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b0e10a07-9e8d-49c3-a34e-426485ae0649/EA846431-4FE2-46CB-810F-E9D9D18F7409.jpeg)
        
    2. The miners, or the nodes working to maintain and update the ledger, gather the latest transaction data in their memory pool. They verify an average of 500 transactions per block before starting the mining competition. 
    
    1. They will individually select the transactions with higher incentive fees to group together in their candidate block. They run all the data through a hashing algorithm that results in a unique string of numbers.
        - If a miner changes even one character in the candidate block, the entire hash changes.
        - By changing the “nonce”, a number used once, they will generate strings of numbers with the purpose of finding one that begins with a long string of zeros.
        
        ![2A0C7A9B-5A71-4DBF-A741-BC57BFF61B74.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2872f2a9-e7e2-4ad1-82e1-dad2877b1048/2A0C7A9B-5A71-4DBF-A741-BC57BFF61B74.png)
        
    2. After guessing numbers for approximately 10 minutes,  which of course uses a lot of computational power,  one of the nodes will finally calculate the winning hash. This node will not only win the block reward, but also all of the transaction fees generated from the verified transactions on the block.
        
        ![BABD562F-94B4-4E13-AD44-E6EA14DDBBD8.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/51ea87fb-2ab1-4776-bd90-e54421d29c22/BABD562F-94B4-4E13-AD44-E6EA14DDBBD8.png)
        
    3. That transaction, along with the many others that made it into the block, will be permanently stored in the blockchain. 
    4. After many blocks have been created and chained together, it is impossible to alter their order or information. Changing even one letter in any block will cause a cascade of failures to the verification of any subsequent block. This is because each block has information about the previous one.

- **Wallets**
    
    # **Types of Wallets & Getting BTC Off Exchanges**
    
    **Definitions**
    
    - A Crypto Wallet is a program and, sometimes, also a device that allows you to interact with the blockchain network.
        - Main function: *to store your cryptocurrency and facilitate sending and receiving.*
        - Every crypto wallet has two main components. A private key and a public key. These two ensure the security of the wallets.
    - Private key: Exists as a way of proving the ownership of the wallet and allows you to access and send Bitcoin out. A private key often comes as a wallet seed, consisting of 12 or 24 short words, since this key is associated with the public key, can also be used as a way to recover your Sats or Bitcoins. This key is private to the owner.
    - Public key: Is an automatically generated address that will allow you to receive cryptocurrencies from others ( think of it as your bank routing and account number). This key is public and can be shared with anyone you want.
    
    ![906B1610-4319-44D3-9219-06E6F3325546.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/dd7c7f57-10b9-404e-9824-8e67e8e7778c/906B1610-4319-44D3-9219-06E6F3325546.jpeg)
    
    Which are the main types of wallets?
    
    - Cold wallets: They are also known as “offline” wallets, since they are not connected to the internet. These are considered the most secure kinds of wallets. The keys are stored in a hardware device.
    - Hot wallets: Are the ones connected to the internet, and can be accessed online (web version) or through an application.
    
    ![39C2F782-B6D7-499C-B963-1DE40500B404.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bfe54911-e593-4d43-890c-14caf76faf00/39C2F782-B6D7-499C-B963-1DE40500B404.jpeg)
    
    - **Bitcoin Wallet Architectures**
        
        
        ![Screenshot 2022-03-27 082205.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4d19c834-fd71-4a0a-af27-c6d75773d1d1/Screenshot_2022-03-27_082205.png)
        
        - Paper wallets: Private and Public keys are written on a paper, this is one of the most secure ways to store your Sats, but the least practical, because you’d be typing your private keys every time you want to make a transaction.
        - Hardware wallets: They are basically “usb sticks” and are not connected directly to the internet. This kind of wallets usually stores your public and private keys, and uses a very secure process to access them
        - Software wallets: They are the most common ones and are usually “apps” or web versions.
            
            ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/af3c1b2d-70a8-4d98-937f-7febe214fc98/Untitled.png)
            
        - Custodial Wallets: Private keys are in control of the wallet supplier, this means that they also have control over your funds. Although, if you lose or forget the access to your account, there are easy options for recovering your login. This kinds of wallets are always connected to the internet, which makes them more vulnerable.
        - Non Custodial Wallets: The user has complete control over their private keys, this means they are the only ones with access to the funds. On the other hand, there is not a possible way to recover the account in the case of losing access to the login credentials for the wallets. Without any internet connection, these wallets are secure from cyber threats.
            
            ![926A3212-A362-49C5-BA30-92306C2E315B.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6615b51b-1b6c-403a-8081-df4fcda46aea/926A3212-A362-49C5-BA30-92306C2E315B.png)

    - On-chain: All wallets that can hold Bitcoin can send and receive them by connecting to the blockchain using the “on-chain” method. This is a secure but slow network that can take a few minutes to confirm a transaction. This network may also have relatively high fees to up to 5% of the amount.
    - Lightning Network: There are some wallets that can also send and receive Bitcoin using the lightning network, a “layer 2” solution to on-chain that allows users to send and receive Bitcoins paying very low or no fees, at a much faster time. These wallets are used in countries where local policies and regulation encourage mass adoption, and a quick, cheap and efficient transaction solution is required.
- **A Bitcoin Transaction**
    
    ![94ABE95E-B463-46C9-A03E-5CB5A77BBA5E.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e987cebb-1bd8-42c3-9368-51aae2b86889/94ABE95E-B463-46C9-A03E-5CB5A77BBA5E.png)
    
    1. Assuming Rob wants to send bitcoin to his friend, Laura. Rob opens his wallet and first has to unlock his bitcoin. He creates his private and public keys as described above.
        - Imagine if all bitcoin were held in a glass security box by the network, where everyone sees what is inside, but only the owner of each box can access the contents. By sending bitcoin to another person, one is just transferring them into another deposit box and locking them with the recipient’s public key. The recipient will only be able to open that security box with his/her private key in the future.
        
        ![4BA7A640-1EB1-4F10-9C38-836468A5C395.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3e93cd0a-187d-4db8-9920-b2ffcf43618d/4BA7A640-1EB1-4F10-9C38-836468A5C395.png)
        
    2. Rob creates a message by scanning or copying Laura’s addresses, specifying the quantity he wants to send, and adding a reasonable transaction fee so that the miners are incentivized to add his transaction to the next block. All of this sums up to simply a single line of data.  
        
        
    3. Now, in order to unlock his bitcoin and be able to move it, Rob will create a new digital signature. 
        
        
        ![8A1AD014-C5BB-4930-B76E-375B62CA6EEE.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0eddb76f-965e-453b-890f-ae685b027860/8A1AD014-C5BB-4930-B76E-375B62CA6EEE.png)
        
    4. By signing the transaction and broadcasting it into the network, he waits until it gets propagated to all the nodes, verified, and selected by the node that will ultimately add it to the next block. 
    5. After about 10 minutes, Laura will finally receive a confirmation and the bitcoin Rob sent will now be locked in her public address. 
    6. If Rob did not transfer all of his bitcoin to Laura, he should not keep the remainder in the original address for security reasons. He should instead,  transfer the remaining value to a new address that he creates for himself and locks it as well.
        
        ![2A5A6836-2658-496B-A703-0437415A21AE.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/28583b8c-21ec-4a0e-9eaa-4a28ccd442f5/2A5A6836-2658-496B-A703-0437415A21AE.png)
        
    7. Rob was not the only one waiting for his transaction to be confirmed. For transactions that did not make it into a particular block, they will remain in a holding area of the nodes, called the memory pool.

- **PROPOSED PROJECT 2: How to send Bitcoin.**
    - Show the students how to officially send Bitcoin — this means downloading the wallet of choice, which hopefully already has Bitcoin on it. (If not, we’ll have to send a tiny amount to each wallet, let’s talk to John about this.)
    - Have them send amounts to each other. Maybe we can think of a fun game here.
    - Show the students how to go through exchanges to purchase Bitcoin, which ones are KYC and which ones are not.
    - How long they should expect to wait before they get Bitcoin.
    - How to get it off the exchanges safely.
    - Good practices for storing seed phrase.
    - Which hardware wallets are trustworthy and why.

class 7

- **Nodes**
    
    A node on the blockchain**,** or a single computer running on the Bitcoin program, has only three jobs:
    
    1. **Follow rules** 
    
    ![614DA023-C728-4527-BAB2-448F731277B7.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b0399598-0a9e-446f-aaf3-273bdd302a2e/614DA023-C728-4527-BAB2-448F731277B7.jpeg)
    
    1. **Share Information**
        
        A node’s main job is to share information with other nodes, and the most important information a node shares is transactions.
        
        There are two types of transactions that nodes share:
        
        1. *Fresh transactions* – transactions that have recently entered the network and go directly into the memory pool.
        2. *Confirmed transactions* – transactions that have been “confirmed” and written to a file. These are shared in *blocks* of transactions, and not individually.
        
        ![05435580-499A-4B0A-A118-424984E7F8E5.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e04147ac-983a-4946-a6cd-8ee957bf34b1/05435580-499A-4B0A-A118-424984E7F8E5.png)
        
    2. **Keep a copy of confirmed Transactions**
        
        Transactions (usually consisting of sending and receiving bitcoin) are bounced around the network until they are permanently recorded into the blockchain, which is a ledger of confirmed transactions.
        
        ![2D474DDC-E910-4ABD-8131-ACB5B4EFCD77.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4e00d6cf-ea41-4f1f-b54f-fc2907c09eea/2D474DDC-E910-4ABD-8131-ACB5B4EFCD77.jpeg)
        
        Each node has a copy of the blockchain for safe keeping, and shares it with other nodes if their copy isn’t up to date. This sharing of information (e.g. transactions) is what allows the nodes on the network to keep up-to-date, which is key to run a successful digital currency on the Internet. 
        
- **Lightning Network- The off-chain approach**
    - Lightning addresses Bitcoin’s scalability problems.
        - Bitcoin transactions can get slow and expensive.
        - In its current form, while Visa can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, the Bitcoin network can only handle 7 transactions per second.
        - Even though Bitcoin and other blockchains are revolutionary in the sense that they are the base layers of the decentralized internet, they have a fundamental scalability problem.
            - One of the main arguments of why bitcoin cannot be used as a medium of exchange is due to how slowly it works and how expensive it is to send micropayments through the network. Imagine paying for your afternoon snack and seeing a $50 fee…. And then to top that, having to wait 10 minutes for your transaction to be confirmed.
        - That is where the magic of *layer two solutions*, such as Lightning, or parallel payment universes, have come to the rescue. Lightning, which is a set of rules (smart contracts) built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain, enables instant, high volume, off-chain transactions. It is considered a layer 2 solution and the idea behind it is that smaller transactions do not have to be recorded on the main blockchain, but rather, off-chain. It provides all the security that Bitcoin has without any drawbacks. Additionally, it provides more privacy.
    
    ![163D07BA-42D3-4E3E-9CCC-7DBDA1E7587A.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/63a8a210-1861-493e-9383-af61eacc7dc1/163D07BA-42D3-4E3E-9CCC-7DBDA1E7587A.png)
    
    - **Analogy**:
        - How many times, when checking into a hotel have you been asked to hand over your credit card to cover room and tax charges, resort fees and incidentals for your stay? This is definitely more efficient and less costly than running your credit card every time you incur in an expense. The hold usually stays in place days after you check out to make sure there were no damages to the room. The hotel keeps a tab of your expenses and, if you happen to complain, will also deduct the necessary amount, but does not charge the card until the end of the stay. Moreover, the hotel will only charge the card after you have verified that the charges and the balance is correct.
        - The Lightning Network works similarly. Instead of giving someone a credit card, any two people can open a payment channel (in which one, or both parties deposit an initial amount of money, say 10 BTC). The parties can then start transacting as many times as they wish, while approving each movement between them with signatures to keep their balance always updated. This does not require them to update and verify each transaction in the Bitcoin Network, which would be both costly and very time consuming. When either party decides to close the tab and secure their bitcoin, they can unilaterally broadcast the latest transaction onto the blockchain.
        - The Lightning Network is as cheap and fast as sending an email, but with the added benefit of the security of the blockchain (since it can be broadcast at any moment), and an extra layer of privacy due to encryption. Only the two people interacting in any open channel will know how much, how often and when that money is moved.
            
            ![DE7283BA-9D3A-45B6-9B93-C22E78F39415.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/18ad71cc-ac99-4eb0-bd61-5b5e1e6d1e52/DE7283BA-9D3A-45B6-9B93-C22E78F39415.jpeg)
            
    
    - Just as a comparison, if the 10 BTC had remained on-chain, the transactions would have happened much slower and with higher fees. It can be visualized as follows:
    
    ![74301D93-91DD-4767-BAFC-C0687792E9CE.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/68e3a57d-6b50-428f-af81-a68c653e4107/74301D93-91DD-4767-BAFC-C0687792E9CE.png)
    
    - Going beyond two people, the LN would be very inefficient if one had to open channels with everyone they would want to interact with. Instead, it allows for already open channels to serve as links between two non-connected people.
    - If A has an open channel with B and B has an open channel with C, A can send BTC to C through B without the need to trust or know B. This is thanks to the smart contract functionality of this layer two solution.

- **PROPOSED PROJECT 4: How to Run Your Own Bitcoin Node.**
    - [**Bitcoin Node Simulator](https://www.bitcoinsimulator.tk/explanation?page=1) is what we should go with here**
    
    **What you can do with the simulator:**
    
    - Mine a block to receive your first Bitcoin as a reward
    - Sign transactions and send Bitcoin to other wallets
    - Create your own private blockchain and use the simulator with non-public groups or school classes
    - Create fake transactions under a false name and try to obtain Bitcoin by fraud
    - Perform a 51% attack to subsequently manipulate the blockchain
    - Tell other people about it. The more understand how Bitcoin works, the better.
    - So setting up a node thru Bitcoin Core can just be [seen here.](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#other-linux-daemon) Setting this up might take the whole class, but since they might not have 7 GB available on the laptop, and since it’s a little technical, you might have to walk them through that as a class, or make it homework. Could also be a final project.
        - Of course, while you can use an ordinary non-node-connected wallet, it’s even better if you use the Bitcoin Core wallet for your transactions (which you can then send again to a different day-to-day or cold-storage wallet, if you like).
        - Other source to set up Bitcoin Node [through Windows](https://armantheparman.com/run-a-bitcoin-node-with-windows-and-virtualbox-linux/)...
        - ... through [a Mac](https://armantheparman.com/bitcoin-core-full-node-on-mac-os-with-electrum-personal-server-and-electrum-desktop-wallet/)...
        - ...or through a [Raspberry Pi](https://mynodebtc.com/download.php) (which is simpler).

- **Halving**
    
    # HALVING: Natural Scarcity & Value through time
    
    **Intro:** When Bitcoin was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, he designed a way for new bitcoins to be distributed without a person or group of people deciding who should get them. The idea called bitcoin mining was to reward people with new bitcoin for doing the work of verifying new transactions into new blocks through computational work. In other words, new bitcoin are created as a **reward** for miners **verifying blocks** in the blockchain. When Bitcoin started, the reward was set to 50 coins per block, but Satoshi Nakamoto put into the protocol a rule where every 210,000 blocks or roughly every 4 years the reward would be cut in half and so is named by **halving event**. 
    
    *Remember when we looked at the blockchain explorer? Let’s go back to that and see Block 1! introduction of website [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com) and search for block 1 and show the reward of 50 BTC, then search for blocks 210,000 and 210,001 to show the first halving event.* 
    
    *Students here can go and check for themselves.*
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a38135f7-581a-4838-b1ce-e01d8c82e808/Untitled.png)
    
    Halving events:
    
    - The first halving occurred in late 2012 where block number 210,000 rewarded 50 coins to the winning minor...
    - ...but then block number 210,001 only awarded to the winning miner 25 coins.
    - The second halving event occurred in mid-2016 halving the block reward again, so they're rewarded for blocked number 420,001 came in the amount of 12.5 bitcoins.
    - And so it will go until sometime near the year 2140, when all 21 million bitcoins will have been mined.
    
    This halving of rewards has been added  with the intention of:
    
    - Preventing inflation
    - Adding natural scarcity
    
    Now we will understand why this is done and how the halving events achieve this.
    
    ***So why the change? Why not keep the reward the same? Isn't that unfair to the minors?*** 
    
    ***The answer to that question lies in the law of supply and demand.***
    
    If coins are created too quickly and there is no end to the number of bitcoins that can be created, eventually there will soon be too many bitcoins in circulation and their value will decrease. The following graph exemplifies how halving impacts price over time: 
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bceb82db-473d-4064-8dc8-4fe00c63f429/Untitled.png)
    
    - *The reward is halved*
    - *→ lower available supply*
    - *→ half the inflation*
    - *→ higher demand*
    - *→ higher price*
    - *→ miners' incentive still remains, regardless of smaller rewards, as the value of Bitcoin is increased in the process*
    
    This keeps **inflation** under control.
    
- **Bitcoin value through time**
    
    Bitcoin’s value since 2009 (first transaction) has hugely increased from less than $0.01 to around $67k, its highest value ever, reached back in November of 2021. In the last decade its price has gone up and down a few times, and the factors affecting its supply and demand have changed and diversified a lot as well.
    
    Three questions:
    
    - **Why is bitcoin valuable?**
    - **Why has the price increased so much?**
    - **Why is it so volatile?**
    
    To better understand this, here are some important concepts to discuss:
    
    1. **Circulating supply**: is the best approximation of the number of assets that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands. For Bitcoin the circulating supply equals the amount of Bitcoins created.
    2. **Total Supply**: Reflects the total amount of coins that have already been created or mined. Not all coins included in this metric are available for use and coins that have been burned are not included. In the case of Bitcoin, the maximum amount that can ever be created is capped at 21 million, although it is estimated that around 4 million Bitcoins are missing or considered “lost”. (This is different from “burned” because there are cryptocurrencies that destroy their coins, but the idea is the same.)
    3. **Market Cap**: The total market value of Bitcoin circulating supply. This is estimated by multiplying the current price and the Circulating supply.
        1. Market Cap = Current Price x Circulating Supply.
    
    *Here, an example with the students can be made by going to [marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) and calculate the current market cap based on price and supply.*
    
    The following graph shows Bitcoin’s price over the last 5 years. This is an easy way to visualize how sensitive or volatile the price is. Using the X axis for time, what major world events can you name that could relate to price changes?
    
    [https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DJuC6h2XxzgGwKc53R_hh82-syrjzOQJKMcxNkb85foZxqoC5pPYaHtEUfdn_1pWZhh-R4nP1aO3pcMjKxJ2BNTouQ132PAQ53lMuVN7DATjt9fRfB4mKT75qcmj-IXrQxDyeIvR](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DJuC6h2XxzgGwKc53R_hh82-syrjzOQJKMcxNkb85foZxqoC5pPYaHtEUfdn_1pWZhh-R4nP1aO3pcMjKxJ2BNTouQ132PAQ53lMuVN7DATjt9fRfB4mKT75qcmj-IXrQxDyeIvR)
    
    **So what factors determine its price? How is mining involved? When does halving impact the price?**
    
    There are simple and complex factors and events that significantly affect its price. One thing that can be said with certainty is that since its creation, the price of Bitcoin has moved up and to the right based on the fixed supply and growing demand. The factors that affect how price moves can be analyzed on a medium and long term. 
    
    **Medium Term factors:**
    
    - Daily trading: Bitcoin as many other cryptocurrencies, can be bought and sold through multiple exchange platforms that unlike banks and stock markets, operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These exchange platforms can operate on mobile device, allowing you to trade a few dollars to as much of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in Bitcoin. For an asset that has no regulators or authorities, volatility on price is highly expected. For HODLers this is a nightmare as price can change up to 20% in a single day. For daily traders this is an opportunity to take advantage of these price changes and make a profit.
    - News and world events: As many other markets, Bitcoin price can also change based on world events, news and speculation.
    - Mining costs: As we know, miners are the ones responsable of adding more and more bitcoins to the total supply. Due to electricity costs, miners are generally forced to sell 40% - 60% of the mined bitcoins in order to cover bills and hardware expenses.
    - Market bubbles: In the recent years, bitcoin buyers are more and more diverse, and their purchasing and saving habits vary. The size of their involvement in Bitcoin, and their behavior towards it, can change the overall price of Bitcoin.

    **Long Term factors:**
    
    - Halving (See Halving Section)
    - Mass adoption: (If everybody is using it, and then by extension putting more of their money into Bitcoin, the price will go up exponentially. The moment when everyone suddenly begins to use Bitcoin is called *Hyperbitcoinization.*)
    - Limited supply: The fact that there are only a finite amount of Bitcoin means that no dilution of the system is possible after 2140. (In the meantime, with new Bitcoin being added to the system every day to add up to 21 million, it is still technically inflationary, although on a clear and consistent schedule, so that new participants can join the system. If all 21 million were to have been released at once, it may have been hoarded by a few people, giving no one else the chance to use it!)

## **A Future With Bitcoin & The Future of Bitcoin**

- **The Future of & with Bitcoin**
    - El Salvador has become the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender in parallel with the US Dollar.
        - The IMF and the World Bank have spoken against this decision; meanwhile, Nayib Bukele is stacking sats for himself and El Salvador.
        - This decision has kicked off an arms race — who will make Bitcoin legal tender next? The countries we expect to benefit the most from Bitcoin will be the ones who adopt it the earliest.
        - Bitcoin Beach is already a phenomenon, with outside money flooding into El Salvador.
        - The US dollar seems to be on the verge of collapse, with the Ruble (Russia) and Yuan (China) taking a greater role in geopolitics. Both, of course, are just fiat, competing with Bitcoin.
            - Several countries are trying to implement CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) — these are attempts to be fiat that has the benefits of being digital, which also means the government can surveil every transaction.
        - Who’s taking Bitcoin: The news is changing so fast —
            - Russia is willing to accept oil and gas in Bitcoin
            - Rio De Janiero is willing to accept real estate taxes in Bitcoin
            - Some US cities are willing to accept taxes in Bitcoin, and some government officials take their salaries in Bitcoin.
            - And more.
        - Where does El Salvador stand on this?
            - It stands to be a prosperous nation by bringing in all of its un- and underbanked into financial inclusion.
            - Depending on how many El Salvadorans adopt Bitcoin, they will avoid the massive inflation the US Dollar is currently experiencing
            - Lower time preference means El Salvadorans will truly build generational wealth
            - The chance to fully modernize, in a 21st century way, so many of their cities while still being integrated with nature
            - El Salvador may become a world tech hub for Bitcoin, the way Silicon Valley was for California + the United States, opening the door to bringing in people who want a sovereign and free nation.
        - Bitcoin will allow people to innovate massively on Layer 2 solutions and beyond, modernizing contracts, assets, and more in ways we can’t possibly fathom today.
        - Bitcoin will encourage nation-states to cooperate rather than compete; because there’s no longer a desire to manipulate the economies of other countries by printing money, or by making a currency the global reserve currency others have to adopt, trade is easier to do, and endless wars will be much harder (and less incentivizing) to do.
        - It may even be that nation-states will no longer exist, and something new will take their place, with the help of bitcoin... who knows?
        
    - Questions:
        - What do you see as being the benefits of Bitcoin?
        - What do you imagine might happen in El Salvador in the next ten years?
        - Do you believe El Salvadorans will warm up to Bitcoin more and find it an essential technology?

# Final Projects

- Possible projects:
    - Teach someone you know about Bitcoin
    - Set up a booth somewhere in town during the week and help at least 5 people get their wallets set up, or answer any questions they have about BTC
    - Do a video where you ask people their opinions on Bitcoin and show the before + after of your conversation
    
    Other projects??
    
    - What are some of the main [myths](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths) about Bitcoin? Can you debunk them?

## not included

- **PROPOSED PROJECT 3: How to Mine Bitcoin (with your computer!... not that you’ll stack many sats. Also, show Mining as a Service + mining pools.)**
    - For mining software, see [source.](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/bitcoin-mining-software/)
        - and listen to the fan whir like crazy... ;)
    - Example of Bitcoin mining cloud service
        - [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=d3dde543-7701-493b-a32c-c8f55331fa31) — Basically you buy a certain amount of energy, and they give you Bitcoin in return.
    - Join a mining pool — [source.](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/bitcoin-mining-pools/)
        - Groups of Bitcoin miners working together to solve a block and share in its rewards. Without working together you may never earn Bitcoin (not for years anyway).
        - Slush Pool demo might be worthwhile to show @Raul Enrique Guirola @Gloriana Solano [Link.](https://slushpool.com/en/home/)
- **The Deep Stuff (optional)**
    
    The fields contained in the block header must be:
    
    - [ ]  The **Last Block** An identification number (or the digital fingerprint) for the previous block.  This is what will assure that if this block is selected in the chain, there will be no way to ever change the order in which it was added.
        
        <aside>
        💡 The goal of the miner is get one of these for the current candidate block that satisfies some conditions (it should be below a certain target number)
        
        </aside>
        
    
    - [ ]  A **Merkle Root** All of the transactions inside the block hashed together to form a single line of text. All of the fields are unique, but it would be fair to think of this as the most significant part of the block header.
        
        ![735E5EDE-3B77-47FB-96E9-A345AB9E6BD7.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8928a8b7-b5fb-4761-bc2e-4b2ab9732e26/735E5EDE-3B77-47FB-96E9-A345AB9E6BD7.png)
        
    - [ ]  **Difficulty**  A value set by the bitcoin network that is designed to regulate how quickly blocks are solved. This difficulty value updates approximately every  2 weeks (exactly Transactions are confirmed when a miner is able to generate a valid hash that results in a new block being “found.” When a miner finds a new block that is accepted by the entire Bitcoin network, it is rewarded in newly minted bitcoin, and transactions waiting to be confirmed are placed into this new block and added to the blockchain. 2016 blocks) to ensure that it takes 10 minutes, on average, to add a new block to the blockchain.  If the difficulty remained the same, it would take less time between adding new blocks to the blockchain as new miners join the network. This would make bitcoin susceptible to the same rising stock-to-flow ratio that plagues inflationary fiat currencies and even scarce minerals like silver. As part of Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution to creating the soundest money, difficulty must increase when the value of a bitcoin increases, since new miners expend resources (hardware and electricity) to reap potential monetary benefits.
        - [ ]  The Current **Time**
            
            
        - [ ]  A **Target**  A value that miners work with to try and add candidate block to the blockchain. This number is calculated from the difficulty,  which is a value set by the bitcoin network to regulate how difficult it is to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. The smaller the number (the more leading zeros in the string), the harder the puzzle.
        - [ ]  A **Nonce** number used once…. basically a dummy field that miners use to help them get a block hash below the target value.
            
            ![9C5978C7-1370-4F2F-8178-C41080448E40.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f8a4fe21-f071-4002-8b1e-004e8a7bb777/9C5978C7-1370-4F2F-8178-C41080448E40.png)
            
    
    After creating the block header, miners select transactions (usually the ones that have larger fee incentives) from their memory pool and place them on a newly created “candidate block”.  In order to do this, each node must condense all the selected transactions into a single “string” of numbers and letters.
    
    ![BA39A6CA-7926-419C-BFA2-4D3B4E8FE41D.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f5fee989-b6c6-48e1-8828-1b342c80a741/BA39A6CA-7926-419C-BFA2-4D3B4E8FE41D.png)
    
    This completely random, yet unique scramble of letters and numbers is the candidate’s block fingerprint. In reality, it is actually a hexadecimal value that uses the letters A-F as well as the digits 0-9 to represent a number.
    
    For a block to be successfully added on to the blockchain, this number  (the block’s hash must be below a specific target number, which is a threshold number that everyone on the network agrees upon.
    
    ![https://learnmeabitcoin.com/common/images/home/3_3_mining_block_hash.png](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/common/images/home/3_3_mining_block_hash.png)
    
    Do you remember that nonce we mentioned? The number used once? Ok, here is where it will come in handy. If your resulting **block hash** is *not* below the target, you can make a small adjustment to the nonce inside the block and put it through the hash function again. This will produce a *completely different* number that will hopefully be below the target. If not, you adjust the block and try again.

- **Cryptography**
    - [(Link for anyone interested in checking out the math here, including for the students!)](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/overview-bitcoins-cryptography)
    - The difficulty of mining math problems means that it’s much easier to add to the blockchain than it is to cheat it. (In fact, given how long the blockchain is now, it’s basically impossible to cheat!)
        - Miners use their computers to perform the cryptographic work required to add new transactions to the ledger. As compensation for their hard work, they get a small amount of cryptocurrency themselves.
        - Transactions are confirmed when a miner is able to generate a valid hash that results in a new block being “found.” When a miner finds a new block that is accepted by the entire Bitcoin network, it is rewarded in newly minted bitcoin, and transactions waiting to be confirmed are placed into this new block and added to the blockchain.
    
- “Not your keys, not your coins!” (Somewhat controversial since I just found out that El Chivo wallet is custodial). **Teach someone about the importance of self-custody.**
    
    
    Can bitcoin be debased or lost?
    
    Bitcoin can’t be multiplied or created arbitrarily, but it is likely that banks, central governments and other large companies start accepting bitcoin deposits and make use of [fractional](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fractional_Reserve_Banking_and_Bitcoin) reserve banking just like they do with fiat currency. If, as the Bitcoin Network grows, we do not teach individuals the importance of keeping their own keys, there could be future dire consequences to the economy. We do not want a perceived inflationary economy, even if the amount of hard bitcoins has not changed.
    
    In addition, when a third party custodian stores your keys, there is no guarantee of ownership. There are many reasons why you can lose your bitcoin such as:
    
    - Hackers
    - Inside jobs
    - Ponzi  schemes
    - Bankruptcy of the custodian
    - Regulators freezing accounts
    

- (**Narrative Format)**
    1. **Blockchain & Mining**
    - Intro
        
        Let's start with some quick definitions. ... **bitcoin** is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency, the one for which blockchain technology was invented. **Blockchain** is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system**.**
        
        First, let’s think of Bitcoin just as any computer program. You can download it and run it on any computer. Its function though, is to let you store, send, and receive money without any banks or credit card companies. With Bitcoin, there’s no central authority or centralized ledger. That’s because it operates in a *decentralized* manner with a *distributed* ledger, known as blockchain. Unlike the traditional banking system, anybody can be directly connected to and participate in the shared Bitcoin “system.” You can send and receive payments without going through a central bank. That’s why it’s called decentralized digital currency.

        Anyone in the world who wishes to run this program, will immediately connect to the **Network** of computers that communicate with each other. All this happens for one reason…to share a large file of ever growing data, and this file is the actual blockchain.
        
    
    - Blockchain technology-
        
         The technology designed to let you safely transfer digital property, without the need for any middlemen. Skipping middlemen makes transfers faster and cheaper. One fundamental benefit of the blockchain is that it enables secure payments to be made between people who don’t know each other without having to go through a third-party verifier like a bank. A blockchain can be thought of as a huge database of information (sometimes you’ll hear the terms ‘distributed ledger’ or ‘immutable ledger’), that is similar to the balance sheet of a bank. 
        
        Many cryptocurrencies are powered by this technology. The Bitcoin blockchain, for example, contains a record of every time someone sent or received bitcoin.
        
        Like a bank’s ledger, the blockchain tracks all the money flowing into, out of, and through the network, but unlike a financial institution,  it keeps a permanent record of all transactions that have ever happened on it. Strong computer code ensures that nobody can change these records after the fact. Once information is added to the blockchain, it’s impossible to remove it. 
        
        Because of their cryptographic design, payments via blockchain can be more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. There is almost zero risk of a person’s financial information or identity being compromised, since no sensitive information is needed for  transactions.
        
        Unlike a bank’s books, a crypto blockchain isn’t maintained by any individual or organization, including banks and governments. In fact it isn’t centralized at all. Instead, it is secured by a large peer-to-peer, decentralized network ****of ****computers running open-source software**.**  The network is constantly checking and securing the accuracy of the blockchain.  These are a lot of words to digest in a few sentences… we will get to all of them and clarify.
        
        In simple terms, nothing in life is free. In order to keep the network’s security intact, computers have to expend a lot of work. Keeping in mind that someone has to buy those computers, pay for their electricity, and probably profit for their time invested, the network has to compensate them in some way. Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoin are entered into circulation.
        
    
    - Open source code-
        
        Is software code (or a computer program) that **a**nyone can see, modify, and distribute as they see fit. So imagine this like going to a restaurant and having access to the recipes of your favorite meals… but then you can make them and add any or take away any ingredient that you wish  and serve them for your family dinners.
        
    - Centralized vs. Decentralized Systems Visualized
        
        ![https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/centralized-decentralized-systems-cryptocurrency.png](https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/centralized-decentralized-systems-cryptocurrency.png)
        
    - A Centralized System
        
        In the left half of the graphic is an illustration of a centralized system. The traditional centralized currency system in most economies operates through the use of computers, networks and technologies that are owned, operated and maintained by financial institutions. That means that every single transaction has to go through the central banking system, where it’s recorded. So, whenever you send money to a family member or a friend, there is always a central authority that controls, maintains, and updates a centralized record (ledger). Moreover, it is a very restricted system — only a small number of organizations (banks and governments) are allowed to connect directly and/or control the rules, verify that people are acting in good faith, enforce the regulations and keep a copy of all the transactions.
        
    - A decentralized system such as The Bitcoin Network, is described as a “[peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) network”, because:
        1. Everyone is connected to each other with the internet, so it’s a network.
        2. Everyone is responsible for his/her own device but lend and share his/her resources.
        3. Everyone on the network is equal 
        4. Everyone shares the responsibility of verifying transactions, updating, and maintaining redundant versions of the ledger simultaneously.
    - Bitcoin Uses a Decentralized Distributed System
        
        Distribution refers to a ledger that is publicly available, shared across various locations by multiple participants (known as nodes) who serve as observers and verifiers of the transactions. This database is updated almost instantly and all users always have access to the most recent version of it.
        
        ![https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cryptocurrency-distributed-ledger.png](https://sectigostore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cryptocurrency-distributed-ledger.png)
        
        But without a central bank, how are transactions verified before being added to the ledger? 
        
        - Problems with Digital Cash Systems
            
            Checking if there is enough money in an account before a transaction is processed is not the only problem with digital cash systems. A person can actually insert two conflicting transactions into the network at the same time. For example, let’s say Sarah owes both Bill and Tom 0.2 BTCbut has exactly 0.2BTC in her wallet. She creates two transactions simultaneously. She sends 0.2BTC to Bill and also sends 0.2 BTC to Tom. She sends each transaction to different nodes on the network.
            
            ![521AFA43-F74D-412A-9572-7E4C5199BA48.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4555f9c6-54af-40e7-aeda-fe1f34a4599f/521AFA43-F74D-412A-9572-7E4C5199BA48.png)
            
            Both of these transactions can't be written to the file, as that would be a "double-spend". Still, we have a network of computers with conflicting transactions on them, and no single computer is in charge. So how can we decide?Instead of using a central banking system to verify transactions, Bitcoin uses a process called **mining.**
            
    - Bitcoin Network
        
        These are the “bitcoin clients” and it is made up by everyone that is running the bitcoin software. They pass on information about what’s going on in other parts of the network. This is done by sending each other *messages*.  For example, a message could be information about a new ****transaction.
        
        The requirement of running Bitcoin Core, which is the original program created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, is that one needs to download ****and ****store ****the ****full ****blockchain. Every time another copy of the blockchain is created, the network becomes more secure and and transactions to other computers become easier to relay. 
        
        However, not everyone has the hard drive space to store their own copy of the blockchain.
        
        So instead of running Bitcoin Core, people can use something called a bitcoin “wallet” instead. Wallets allow anyone to send and receive bitcoins, but *without* needing to have a copy of the blockchain.
        
        When a new transaction enters the network, it gets *relayed* from computer to computer until everyone has a copy of the transaction. At roughly 10 minute intervals, a random computer (node) on the network will add the latest transactions they have received on to the blockchain, and share the updates with everyone else on the network. More on this in a bit.
        
    - Memory Pool
        
        Bitcoin solves this problem through a step in the mining process. Instead of writing all new transactions on to the blockchain (if the same cash is spent more than once at the same time), all new transactions get held in a waiting area called the "memory pool". From here, each computer (node) can collect the transactions from their memory pool in to a "block", and try to add this block of transactions on to the blockchain. Whoever adds their block on to the blockchain first decides which transaction makes it. As an incentive to use processing power to try and add new blocks of transactions on to the blockchain, each new block makes available a fixed amount of bitcoins that did not previously exist. Therefore, whoever successfully mines a block, is able to “send” themselves these new bitcoins as a reward for their effort.
        
    - Cryptography
        
        Mining isn’t difficult to understand because it is simply a process of computers attempting to solve math problems. There are two important principles in the process of mining: The first is that the mathematical problem is difficult to solve, and the second is that miners (or nodes that have a copy of the entire blockchain) are competing to be the first to solve the mathematical problems.
        
        Performing cryptographic calculations (solving difficult math problems) for each transaction adds up to a lot of computing work. Miners use their computers to perform the cryptographic work required to add new transactions to the ledger. As compensation for their hard work, they get a small amount of cryptocurrency themselves.
        
        - Hash Functions
            
            A cryptographic hash function is a mini computer program that takes in any amount of data, scrambles it, and produces a digital fingerprint of it.
            
            ![0EDA862E-1805-4CF2-8C74-AE6E108B0216.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ecc59f22-26ce-4af0-aa3b-5b7780a2c6b8/0EDA862E-1805-4CF2-8C74-AE6E108B0216.png)
            
            The amazing thing about hash functions is that:
            
            - You can put as much data as you want in to the hash function, but it will always return the same-length result.
            - The result is unique, so you can use it as a way to identify that data.
            
            So in other words, a hash function allows you to create a fixed-length result for whatever data you put in to it.
            
            ![4F24181C-BCF2-4A31-A247-8AE4AF9E090B.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e2edaf14-0811-4071-b4b3-c7815f9ae22a/4F24181C-BCF2-4A31-A247-8AE4AF9E090B.png)
            
            the particular hash function that Bitcoin uses is called SHA256.
            
    - Nodes
        
        A node on the blockchain**,** or a single computer running on the Bitcoin program, has only three jobs:
        
        1. **Follow rules** 
        
        ![614DA023-C728-4527-BAB2-448F731277B7.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b0399598-0a9e-446f-aaf3-273bdd302a2e/614DA023-C728-4527-BAB2-448F731277B7.jpeg)
        
        1. **Share Information**
            
            A node’s main job is to share information with other nodes, and the most important information a node shares is transactions.
            
            There are two types of transactions that nodes share:
            
            1. *Fresh transactions* – transactions that have recently entered the network and go directly into the memory pool.
            2. *Confirmed transactions* – transactions that have been “confirmed” and written to a file. These are shared in *blocks* of transactions, and not individually.
            
            ![05435580-499A-4B0A-A118-424984E7F8E5.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e04147ac-983a-4946-a6cd-8ee957bf34b1/05435580-499A-4B0A-A118-424984E7F8E5.png)
            
        2. **Keep a copy of confirmed Transactions**
            
            Transactions (usually consisting of sending and receiving bitcoin) are bounced around the network until they are permanently recorded into the blockchain, which is a ledger of confirmed transactions.
            
            ![2D474DDC-E910-4ABD-8131-ACB5B4EFCD77.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4e00d6cf-ea41-4f1f-b54f-fc2907c09eea/2D474DDC-E910-4ABD-8131-ACB5B4EFCD77.jpeg)
            
            Each node has a copy of the blockchain for safe keeping, and shares it with other nodes if their copy isn’t up to date. This sharing of information (e.g. transactions) is what allows the nodes on the network to keep up-to-date, which is key to run a successful digital currency on the Internet. 
            
    - How does Mining actually work?
        
        ![5F72EA1A-9DA4-43E6-85E5-1E2851F910C9.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f28df29c-1fa3-4e69-a253-ac1d4b729517/5F72EA1A-9DA4-43E6-85E5-1E2851F910C9.jpeg)
        
        The mining ****process is basically a network-wide competition**,** where any node on the network has a chance of mining the next block. A node that can mine faster has a better chance of mining the next block, but the process of mining is unpredictable**,** so no single node is in control of adding blocks to the blockchain. 
        
        All nodes begin by creating a new “candidate block”, which will be populated with data and entered into the competition to be next in the chain.  Before selecting which transactions they want to add, they must add a block header. 
        
        As an incentive to use processing power to try and add new blocks of transactions on to the blockchain, each new block makes available a fixed amount of bitcoins that did not previously exist. Therefore, the node that successfully mines a block,  is able to “send” itself these new bitcoins as a reward for its effort.  
        
        When a miner creates a candidate block, the very first space for a transaction is reserved for the coinbase transaction, which is used to claim the block reward and any additional transaction fees.
        
        - The fields contained in the block header must be:
            - [ ]  The **Last Block** An identification number (or the digital fingerprint) for the previous block.  This is what will assure that if this block is selected in the chain, there will be no way to ever change the order in which it was added.
                
                <aside>
                💡 The goal of the miner is get one of these for the current candidate block that satisfies some conditions (it should be below a certain target number)
                
                </aside>
                
            
            - [ ]  A **Merkle Root** All of the transactions inside the block hashed together to form a single line of text. All of the fields are unique, but it would be fair to think of this as the most significant part of the block header.
            
        
        ![735E5EDE-3B77-47FB-96E9-A345AB9E6BD7.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8928a8b7-b5fb-4761-bc2e-4b2ab9732e26/735E5EDE-3B77-47FB-96E9-A345AB9E6BD7.png)
        
        - [ ]  The Current **Time**
        - [ ]  A **Target**  A value that miners work with to try and add candidate block to the blockchain. This number is calculated from the difficulty,  which is a value set by the bitcoin network to regulate how difficult it is to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. The smaller the number (the more leading zeros in the string), the harder the puzzle.
        - [ ]  **Difficulty**  A value set by the bitcoin network that is designed to regulate how quickly blocks are solved. This difficulty value updates approximately every  2 weeks (exactly every 2016 blocks) to ensure that it takes 10 minutes, on average, to add a new block to the blockchain.  If the difficulty remained the same, it would take less time between adding new blocks to the blockchain as new miners join the network. This would make bitcoin susceptible to the same rising stock-to-flow ratio that plagues inflationary fiat currencies and even scarce minerals like silver. As part of Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution to creating the soundest money, difficulty must increase when the value of a bitcoin increases, since new miners expend resources (hardware and electricity) to reap potential monetary benefits.
        - [ ]  A **Nonce** number used once…. basically a dummy field that miners use to help them get a block hash below the target value.
        
        ![9C5978C7-1370-4F2F-8178-C41080448E40.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f8a4fe21-f071-4002-8b1e-004e8a7bb777/9C5978C7-1370-4F2F-8178-C41080448E40.png)
        
        After creating the block header, miners select transactions (usually the ones that have larger fee incentives) from their memory pool and place them on a newly created “candidate block”.  In order to do this, each node must condense all the selected transactions into a single “string” of numbers and letters.
        
        ![BA39A6CA-7926-419C-BFA2-4D3B4E8FE41D.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f5fee989-b6c6-48e1-8828-1b342c80a741/BA39A6CA-7926-419C-BFA2-4D3B4E8FE41D.png)
        
         
        
        This completely random, yet unique scramble of letters and numbers is the candidate’s block fingerprint. In reality, it is actually a hexadecimal value that uses the letters A-F as well as the digits 0-9 to represent a number.
        
        For a block to be successfully added on to the blockchain, this number  (the block’s hash must be below a specific target number, which is a threshold number that everyone on the network agrees upon.
        
        ![https://learnmeabitcoin.com/common/images/home/3_3_mining_block_hash.png](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/common/images/home/3_3_mining_block_hash.png)
        
        Do you remember of that nonce we mentioned? The number used once? Ok, here is where it will come in handy. If your resulting **block hash** is *not* below the target, you can make a small adjustment to the nonce inside the block and put it through the hash function again. This will produce a *completely different* number that will hopefully be below the target. If not, you adjust the block and try again.
        
        The goal of all miners is generate hashes as fast as they can until they find a number below the target value. Their computers work hard in the attempt to win each block. Once someone finds a nonce that works, the block is “solved”, that particular lucky miner gets the reward, the block is broadcast to the network to be verified by all the other nodes, and all of the transactions in this block are added to the blockchain.
        
        ![47816744-EBA9-4B80-A8B4-2857413C64DD.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5283b60c-b499-4be0-90d7-8284d294780e/47816744-EBA9-4B80-A8B4-2857413C64DD.png)
        
        The way Bitcoin validates transactions, as described above, is called Proof of Work and is necessary for security, which prevents fraud, which enables trust. POW works well is because finding the target hash is difficult but verifying it isn't. The process is difficult enough to prevent the manipulation of transaction records. At the same time, once a target hash is found, it's easy for other miners to check it.

        # HALVING: Natural Scarcity & Value through time
        
        When bitcoin was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, he designed a way for new bitcoins to be distributed without a person or group of people deciding who should get them. The idea called bitcoin mining was to reward people with new bitcoin for doing the work of verifying new transactions into new blocks through computational work.
        
        ***Remember what is Bitcoin mining?*** 
        
        Suffice to say that new bitcoin is created as a **reward** for miners **verifying blocks** in the block chain. When bitcoin started, the reward was set to 50 coins per block, but Satoshi Nakamoto put into the protocol a rule where every 210,000 blocks or roughly every 4 years the reward would be cut in half and so is named by **halving event**. 
        
        *Brief introduction of website [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com) and search for block 1 and show the reward of 50 BTC, then search for blocks 210,000 and 210,001 to show the first halving event.* 
        
        *Students here can go and check for themselves.*
        
        ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a38135f7-581a-4838-b1ce-e01d8c82e808/Untitled.png)
        
        The first halving occurred in late 2012 where block number 210,000 rewarded 50 coins to the winning minor, but then block number 210,001 only awarded to the winning miner 25 coins. The second halving event occurred in mid 2016 halving the block reward again, so they're rewarded for blocked number 420,001 came in the amount of 12.5 bitcoins, and so it will go until sometime near the year 2140, when all 21 million bitcoins will have been mined.
        
        This halving of rewards has been added in purpose for 2 important reasons:
        
        - Prevent inflation
        - Add natural scarcity
        
        Now we will understand why this is done and how the halving events achieve this.
        
        ***So why the change? Why not keep the reward the same? Isn't that unfair to the minors?*** 
        
        ***The answer to that question lies in the law of supply and demand.***
        
        If the coins are created too quickly and there is no end to the number of bitcoins that can be created eventually, there will soon be many bitcoins in circulation that they would have very little value. The following graph exemplifies how halving impacts price over time: 
        
        ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bceb82db-473d-4064-8dc8-4fe00c63f429/Untitled.png)
        
        *The reward is halved → lower available supply → half the inflation → higher demand → higher price → miners' incentive still remains, regardless of smaller rewards, as the value of Bitcoin is increased in the process*
        
        ![E8C3AA3A-760A-4A85-98A1-F47FCE58C4ED.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/354f88ec-b0b9-4151-9239-5e290201b52c/E8C3AA3A-760A-4A85-98A1-F47FCE58C4ED.png)
        
        The main reason why this has been done is to keep **inflation** under control. One of the major flaws of traditional fiat currency being controlled by central banks is that the banks can print as much of the currency as they want, and if they print too much the laws of supply and demand ensure that the value of the currency starts dropping quickly.
        
        Bitcoin, on the other hand, is intended to **simulate** a commodity like gold. There is only a limited amount of gold in the world and with every gram of gold that is mined, the gold that still remains becomes harder and harder to extract. As a result of this **limited supply**, gold has maintained it's value as an international medium of exchange and store of value for over 6,000 years, and the hope is that bitcoin will do the same.
        
        - Bitcoin value through time
        - Market cap and liquidity
        
        - **Types of Wallets**
            - Security: Custodial and Non custodial
            - Function: Exchange and BTC only
            - Network: On-chain and lightning

- **Narrative on Blockchain**
    
    Many people think of Blockchain as the technology that powers Bitcoin however it is so†mething much broader than that. In simple words, it is a distributed database that maintains the records of all transactions that have been executed and shared among participating parties. We could have students investigate and write, discuss or make a small power point presentation about one specific industry that is being revolutionized by blockchain technology or they think might be in the future. Will the industry be better or worse off? Benefits? Drawbacks? Examples follow:
    
    1. Vote chain – Electronic Voting System based on Blockchain
    
    Technology is growing tremendously, still, we have to go to the voting booths to cast our vote, So can we make the use of recent technologies to cast our vote safely and within the comfort of our homes? The answer is Yes. We can use blockchain to implement the system. Blockchain is used to build secure and scalable distributed systems. Vote chain, a blockchain-based voting system can help in bringing transparency and security to our voting systems. Now let us understand the working of the system:
    
    - In this system, the ID verifier certifies a customized and unique id for a user to vote
    - After being authorized by the verifier and the registrar, the vote booth UI generates a ballot for the voter to cast their vote.
    
    2. Blockchain-based Patient Data Management System
    
    In the healthcare system, there is a lot of patient data that is stored and this data needs to be safe and private. A lot of research can also be done to improve the healthcare system and find out quick and easier methods to detect and treat diseases. So, we can implement a system using Blockchain in which data will be safe and research will also be performed. Let’s see how this system works:
    
    - In this system, user shares their health data and it is stored as a smart contract on Blockchain. It gives permission for accessibility of data only under certain permissions and thus maintains the security of the data.
    - If researchers want to access any data, they would need the data accessibility permission and then only research can be performed hence preserving the privacy of patient’s data.
    
    3. Blockchain-based Land Registries System
    
    We have observed around us a lot of cases where someone claims another’s land, transaction frauds occur, documents are lost, and many more such issues. Blockchain will help us in solving all these issues and also will maintain the records of the transactions leading to quick and safe retrieval of data. So blockchain-based system which resolves all the land issues will work in the following way:
    
    - Citizen initiates a request
    - After processing it, in the traditional system data is stored in the centralized system. In the case of Blockchain, it will be stored in the decentralized system and thus would reduce the data manipulation and will guarantee further immutability.
    - In the traditional system, a paper certificate is issued after purchase which has the risk of loss, damage, or forgery. It can be replaced by electronic certificates where the data remains safe and reliable.
    
    4. Blockchain in KYC verification
    
    We need to go through a KYC verification in banks for updating our data and verifying our identity. Blockchain permits the secure transfer of KYC verification stamp from one entity to another. It offers a highly immutable and detailed audit trail on all actions on KYC files. Let us understand how this system works:
    
    - The customer uploads KYC data to the Blockchain system.
    - The banks can access KYC data from the Blockchain directly removing intermediaries.
    - Other Institutions verify KYC performed by the bank.
    - In this way, data remains secure, trustworthy, and saves time as data is processed without any intermediaries in the system.
    
    5. Transparent and Genuine Charity Applications based on Blockchain
    
    In these recent times, people are really interested in helping and giving back to the community, but they feel that will this help really reach the needy people? So in such cases, we can make a transparent and genuine charity application that will prove helpful to the community. Let’s see how this system works:
    
    - The needy people would upload their data on the portal connected to the Blockchain system
    - The community can access their data from the Blockchain and would be able to help them directly and safely.
    - Implementation of this system would help in providing help to needy people and will ensure transparency in the transactions.
    
    6. Identifying fake products through a barcode-based Blockchain system
    
    In this modern era, replicated and fake products are found in greater proximity. This leads to the creation of a lot of fake products which results in confusion and distrust among consumers. We can develop a barcode scanning system based on blockchain which will check the originality of products.
    
    - You can scan the barcode using a barcode scanner.
    - The implemented system would check for the originality of the code and if it’s fake it would notify the user and would stop the further transaction thus protecting user safety.
    - This system would lead to identifying genuine products and save the users and company from fake products.
    
    7. Blockchain-based document storage systems
    
    There are a lot of documents and licenses which are really very important for us, and we can be needing them any time. So we can build a secure platform with the help of blockchain which can ensure that our documents are safe and easy to access. This system works in the following way:
    
    - The user will upload their documents to the Blockchain system.
    - The government or any system which requires submission of documents can access them from the Blockchain with the required permissions from the user.
    - This system if implemented would lead to secure, paperless, and quick transactions and would be convenient to the users as well as the government.
